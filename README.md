# üëÅÔ∏è Classifying Gaze Patterns for Preemptive Screening of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Children Using Deep Learning

## üìå Abstract

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition. The incidence of autism in children is rising sharply, presenting a growing challenge for healthcare systems globally. Although atypical behavior often begins to show as early as 12‚Äì18 months of age, the lack of definitive biomarkers impedes timely diagnosis and intervention.

This research investigates the viability of using gaze patterns as early biomarkers for autism by leveraging the **Saliency4ASD** dataset. Our study compares traditional machine learning models with neural network architectures and demonstrates that deep learning approaches significantly outperform conventional methods in classifying atypical gaze behavior. By enabling earlier screening, this approach holds promise for facilitating timely therapeutic interventions.
